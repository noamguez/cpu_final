MIPS Pipeline CPU with GPIO, Timer, and Interrupt Handler - VHDL Project
This repository contains a VHDL project implementing a MIPS pipeline CPU with integrated components for GPIO interfacing using LEDs and HEX displays as outputs, switches as inputs, a basic timer unit with PWM and interrupt generation, and an interrupt handler to facilitate communication between the CPU and the peripherals. 
This project aims to provide a comprehensive example of designing a MIPS-based system with basic I/O, timing, and interrupt functionalities.

Components
MIPS Pipeline CPU
The MIPS pipeline CPU is a multi-stage architecture that optimizes instruction execution by breaking it into several stages, including Instruction Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory Access (MEM), and Write Back (WB). This component is responsible for executing MIPS assembly instructions fetched from memory.

GPIO Interface
The GPIO interface controls LEDs and HEX displays for output and reads switches for input. LEDs and HEX displays can be configured to display specific patterns or values, and switches can be monitored for changes in their states.

Timer Unit
The timer unit is composed of the Basic Timer Control and Clock Registers (BTCCR0, BTCCR1, BTCTL) and generates a PWM signal. The BTCCR0 and BTCCR1 registers set the timer period and compare value respectively, while the BTCTL register configures timer settings. The timer also generates an interrupt when the timer reaches the compare value, indicated by the Basic Timer Interrupt Flag (BTIFG).

Interrupt Handler
The interrupt handler manages interrupts generated by the timer unit and external push buttons. It interacts with the CPU's interrupt enable (IE) and interrupt flag (IFG) registers. If the Global Interrupt Enable (GIE) flag is set in the IE register, and an interrupt condition is met (such as a timer compare match or a push button press), the handler generates an interrupt signal (INTR) that prompts the CPU to jump to the specified memory address (PC of mem[type]).
